#Notes
I mostly used the lectures and class materials for this assignment.  I think examples of what you are looking for would be helpful.  It's hard to know if I am turning in the correct thing or not.  I am just going through step by step and hoping it is correct.  I would like to be more sure.  Also, I wasn't sure about the callback functions.  I couldn't find anything in Canvas about them either.
